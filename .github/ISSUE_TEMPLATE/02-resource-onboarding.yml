        This form is an extension of the "Resourse Suggestion" form. Here you
        can easily suggest many resources to be onboarded onto the knowledge hub!!


        Just download [the template CSV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ClimateTown/knowledge-hub/main/data/resource_onboarding_template.csv)
        (`Ctrl+S` to save as CSV), fill it out, and then attach it by dragging
        and dropping it into the form box below. Want to check out how the current resources
        look like in CSV format? Click "Download resources" on the
        [Knowledge Hub resources page](https://hub.climatetownproductions.com/resources).


        Want to discuss the resources as you curate them? Just submit this form without the
        resources CSV and we can discuss it in the comment section of the issue.
