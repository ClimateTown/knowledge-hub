        Suggest an online resource to add to the Knowledge Hub. This resource
        can be anything directly (or indirectly) related to the climate
        movement. Have a few resources to suggest? Then submit multiple
        of these forms or, for many resources, use the "Resource Onboarding"
        form instead.


        Strict guidelines:

        - All resources must be legal (e.g. no linking to SciHub, Libgen, or any
        other resources that infringe on  copyright of research or books)



        Other considerations:

        - Try suggest resources that are "timeless", and not going to quickly go
        out of date.

        - Avoid linking of specific articles, or YouTube videos (unless they are
        particularly iconic/important)

        - **Title, tags, and resource summary data are used directly in the website**.
        Ensure to follow guidelines provided here in the form. Resource summary should be
        plain text (no markdown formatting or links). Include additional info in
        Relevance/Other comments field if appropriate.


        We will be somewhat liberal with including resources, prioritising
        making many resources available in an easily filterable way.

        or applying one you feel is necessary. See a full list of existing tags
        [here](https://github.com/ClimateTown/knowledge-hub/blob/main/data/resource_tags.yml).

        Provide a summary of the resource ([<300 characters](https://wordcounter.net/character-count)). This will be displayed on
        the website alongside the title. Normally websites have an `og:description`
        tag in their HTML which you can go off (open "Inspect Element" in your browser
        and look for the tag).
