      Suggest an online resource to add to the Knowledge Hub. This resource
      can be anything directly (or indirectly) related to the climate
      movement. Have many resources to suggest? Create a blank issue with a title
      starting with "[RESOURCE ONBOARDING]" instead.


      Strict guidelines:

      - All resources must be legal (e.g. no linking to SciHub, Libgen, or any
      other resources that infringe on copyright of research or books).

      - Keep descriptions under 300 characters.




      Other considerations:

      - Try suggest resources that are "timeless", and not going to quickly go
      out of date.

      - Avoid linking of specific articles, or YouTube videos (unless they are
      particularly iconic/important)


      We will be somewhat liberal with including resources, prioritising
      making many resources available in an easily filterable way.
